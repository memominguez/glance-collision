### Glance collision

This app output resembles a billiards, or air hockey table.

Just two balls involved, the white and a red one.

The white ball is positioned at a selected glance collision offset, then shoot and see what happens.

Buttons:
- RESET - To start a new try.
- MOVE-UP and MOVE-DOWN - To position the white ball.
- AIM - To aim your shoot.
- SHOOT - There you go, and see movement


### Application type: Vanilla Javascript

###  Two subjects about Physics
- Elastic collision, at some glance angle
- Friction while the balls run across, so they stop moving after a while.

## ENJOY IT!
